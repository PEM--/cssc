## Description
This [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) package provides an easy way to create your stylesheets in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/): [CSSC](https://atmospherejs.com/pierreeric/cssc)

Find some additional information on my blog:
* [Create your CSS styles in CoffeeScript](http://pem-musing.blogspot.com/2014/10/create-your-css-styles-in-coffeescript.html)
* [CSS color manipulation and normalize in CoffeeScript](http://pem-musing.blogspot.fr/2014/11/css-color-manipulation-and-normalize-in.html)

## Installation
```bash
meteor add pierreeric:cssc
```

## Usages and API
### Basic usage
The following example creates a new stylesheet with 3 rules: one on the HTML
file and a second on a CSS class `.bubble` and a third for multiple CSSRules:

```coffeescript
mainCss = new CSSC

mainCss
  .add 'html',
    backgroundColor: 'red'
  .add '.bubble',
    backgroundColor: '#FFDC00'
    borderRadius: CSSC.em 0.75
  .add ['h1', 'h2'],
    backgroundColor: 'blue'
```

CSS properties are declared as a dictionary of keys and values respecting
the DOM and CCOM API when called in Javascript.

### Helper functions
They allow working with numerical value instead of strings.
* Pixels `CSSC.px {Number}`:<br>
```coffee
CSSC.px 12
# Returns: '12px'
```
* Percentages `CSSC.pc {Number}`:<br>
```coffee
CSSC.pc 50
# Returns: '50%'
```
* EM `CSSC.em {Number}`:<br>
```coffee
CSSC.em 1.2
# Returns: '1.2em'
```

### Plugins
You can add additional plugins to this package enhancing its capabilities.

Available options are:
* **Colors**: `meteor add pierreeric:cssc-colors`: It imports [colors](http://clrs.cc)
and provides some nice API for color manipulations:
```coffee
CSSC.red
# Returns: '#FF4136'
```
![Colors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEM--/cssc/master/assets/colors.png)
```coffee
# Create a color from an hex String and add alpha blending
c = new CSSC.Clr ['#FF4136', 0.3]
# Add 20% luminance
c.set 'l', (Math.round 1.2 * g.get 'l')
# Get an RGBA string
c.rgba()
```

* **Famo.us**: `meteor add pierreeric:cssc-famous`: It imports as CSSC file, all required CSS styles for [Famo.us](http://famo.us). It removes unnecessary calls to CSS files and the
necessity to put the following in your project:
```javascript
require('famous.core.famous');
```

* **Normalize**: `meteor add pierreeric:cssc-normalize`: It imports as CSSC file all normalized styles just like [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
