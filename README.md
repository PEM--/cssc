## Description
This [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) package provides an easy way to create your stylesheets in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/): [CSSC](https://atmospherejs.com/pierreeric/cssc)

## Installation
```bash
meteor add pierreeric:cssc
```

## Usages and API
### Basic usage
The following example creates a new stylesheet with a single rule on a CSS
class `.bubble`:

```coffeescript
mainCss = new CSSC

mainCss.add '.bubble',
  backgroundColor: '#FFDC00'
  borderRadius: CSSC.x 8
```

CSS properties are declared as a dictionary of keys and values respecting
the DOM and CCOM API when called in Javascript.

### Helper functions
They allow working with numerical value instead of strings.
* Pixels `CSSC.x {Number}`:<br>
```coffee
CSSC.x 12
# Returns: '12px'
```
* Percentages `CSSC.p {Number}`:<br>
```coffee
CSSC.p 50
# Returns: '50%'
```

### Plugins
You can add additional plugins to this package enhancing its capabilities.

Available options are:
* `meteor add pierreeric:cssc-colors`: It imports [colors](http://clrs.cc):
```coffee
CSSC.red
# Returns: '#FF4136'
```

* `meteor add pierreeric:cssc-famous`: It imports as CSSC file, all required CSS styles for [Famo.us](http://famo.us). It removes unnecessary calls to CSS files and the
necessity to put the following in your project:
```javascript
require('famous.core.famous');
```
